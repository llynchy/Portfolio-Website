					<p>Using Hubs and Spoke I created a virtual world based off a Zine I created called "A Square Country".
						Not only is the world a physical square but it also honours pies, the most desired and favoured food of the natives that live there.</p>

				<div class="col-8">
					<!-- a descriptive paragraph -->
					<p>I found the spoke site extremely difficult to use. It would often overwork my computer and result in a very clunky interface and slow loading times.
						Unfortunately, a day before submission I went to check on my Spoke file and I found that it had crashed and produced some sort of error. So I created a new world based off the old one.
						It was a very stressful process but I am at least glad that I have created a Mozilla world that is interactive. There are not many elements in my world however it is still exciting
						virtually walking around in an environment that has been soley created by me.</p>
