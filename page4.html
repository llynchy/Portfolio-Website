					<p>These three pages presented are the final design of the article. I am glad that I didnt stop where I thought I finished the project
						because the title page works a lot better in this spread. This new title page was directly inspired by my previous research of Tonny Cragg’s design.
						The whole process was diffcult and tedious at times, especially working with rags, however I am very pleased with the final outcome.</p>
