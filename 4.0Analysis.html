										The MyMaccas App was only introduced to Australia in May of 2017, claiming that it will “redefine how digital technology can create ease and convenience for its customers” (Media Release, Macca’s delivers the next level of convenience with new mobile ordering app” 2017, May 18). Despite this claim, there are many talking points when it comes to private information and accessibility.
<br>
<h5>									You must create an account to use the app</h5>
<h6>
										Through self-driven research, and proven by ‘darwininandude’ in review 4, you are required to create a login for the app before you are able to utilise any of its functions. Modern-day apps now require constant connectivity with the internet and a digital profile to access almost anything (Beattie, A. 2018). Being connected has become modern-day society's default setting. Beattie appropriately coins that “I no longer access the internet; the internet accesses me”. This statement is so true, especially in terms of the MyMaccas app, as we are all guilty of accepting the terms and conditions of things we don't even realise. It is arguable that we may already be past the point of no return as Internet functionality has become a necessary component in daily and ordinary tasks (Hill, K. & Mattu, S. 2018).
<br>
<h5>										Creating your account with your personal details</h5>
<h6>
										When creating a MyMaccas account, there is nothing binding you to use your legal name and DOB, so don't! All you need to do is input a DOB that is older than age 18 and use a name that you are comfortable with the Macdonalds employees reading out. Based on my research (and as seen in figure 6) 53.8% of people did not realise that when using the MyMaccas App to order, your name appears on the receipt and on the kiosk screen. This happens as soon as you redeem a discount code, automatically logging you into your MyMaccas account. When first noticing this functionality, I found it very alarming as I did not recall typing in my name anywhere in the ordering process. After some reverse engineering, I soon realised that it was the work of the app. I interpret having your name appear on the receipt and kiosk as a breach of privacy because people that are standing around me in the shop can easily look over my shoulder and read out the details. I also noticed how receipts would often be left behind by customers, left on tables and chairs, which would then have their full names disclosed. This means information that has been collected through the app (your name) is being discarded for no real purpose but also has the potential to be viewed be outside people that also do not need to know your details.
<br>
<h5>										Location tracking</h5>
<h6>
										A major flaw of the app is that it requires location services to be turned on. This does not give the user the choice to keep their location undisclosed. When redeeming a discount code from the app and entering it at the store, there is no need to be required to turn your device's location on and select the store you are shopping at. There is no way to bypass the location requirement. You are forced to enable location services and select a Macdonalds store to continue using the app. This is enforced by Geoff Breach in review 1 who strongly voiced his displeasure on the app through the PlayStore review page. The fact that when trying to complete the final stages of ordering your meal, the request to allow location services is the only option that is presented on screen means the user is that handed the problematic situation to either cancel all of their progress and not complete the order or give up their personal information and precise location to make their order successful. Very connivingly, the app developers have included this deceptive design feature to assist in tricking users to give up their location. This lends into what was stated by Professor Tonkinwise in that, “The job of the designer is to enable people to do certain types of things”. Likewise, When you design something as an enabler, you are also designing it as an attractor (Tonkinwise, C. 2022, October). The creation of this deceptive design goes against the purpose of the app. As stated by Rody Bajo in Review 3, “Ordering through the app is pointless”. This is ironic considering the sole purpose of the app is to “redefine how digital technology can create ease and convenience for its customers” (Media Release, Macca’s delivers the next level of convenience with new mobile ordering app” 2017, May 18). So, not only does the online order functionality prove to be irritating due to its requirement of having the users location turned on, but it also is a deceptive attempt at gathering personal information. “The home can be empty, but the smart home will still be active”. Similar to this concept, devices are constantly trying to pull data from us and are “talking to each other”. The MyMaccas App is constantly looking for information, preferences, time stamps, activity and our location to profile and target us (Hill, K. & Mattu, S. 2018).

<br>
<h5>										Information breaches</h5>
<h6>

										Despite being an app for a large corporation, there have been examples in the past which have shown information breaches through customers' MyMaccas accounts. In India, the MyMaccas app had 2.2 million of its user's information leaked by hackers. The information that was stolen included phone numbers, addresses, names, email IDs, home address-related landmarks and social profile links (Goud, N. n.d). The data breach puts into perspective the information we feed into an app that is seemingly harmless and shows how simple features, like enabling location settings, can reveal personal information such as home address-related landmarks. Although a cyber attack is yet to be completed to this scale in Australia, there are still instances of the app giving away personal information. After forgetting she had the app installed on her phone, a Victorian mother was charged for food that she did not purchase. $53.50 was taken from her account by a Macdonalds store in Queensland, despite the mother being from Victoria and never visiting the state (Cox, M. 2020, June 1). After further investigation, she recalled entering her card details to make a payment through the app but distinctly asking it not to save the details. Despite her request, a hacker was able to exploit the innocent intention of the app. 2 years later, a Sydney man was forced into the same situation when he was invoiced $40 for food he did not purchase (Sharples, S. 2022, May 10). Admittingly the man stated, “I was lucky it was $40 and someone buying nuggets as opposed to $1000 being taken” however, the point to be made is that the breach was completed in the first place. Review 5 exemplifies an individual who was unfortunate enough to be charged multiple times through the app. After requesting a refund through Macdonalds, he was promptly refused, stating that he was at fault due to his password getting out. Although seemingly small, the app is proven to be an unsafe platform that collects and exploits personal information.

<br>
<h5>										Summary</h5>
<h6>
										The MyMaccas App is unsafe because it deceptively collects a range of data without the user's knowledge. In addition to this, it also collects information that is not needed. Your legal name, date of birth and credit card details are not required for the app to function in its initially intended way, so users should avoid inputting these details. A significant flaw of the app is also that it requires location services to be turned on. This does not give the user the choice to keep their location undisclosed. When redeeming a discount code from the app and entering it at the store, there is no need to be required to turn your devices location on and select the store you are shopping at.
