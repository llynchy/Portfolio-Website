					<!-- a sub heading -->
					<p>I found the Elements of Design task to be fun as well as challenging. After spending a day of the break going out and
						taking photos of random objects and scenes around me, I quickly realised that the most difficult part of the task will be to
						create a collection of images that are all cohesive with one another. With this in mind, I decided to focus on a single object
						and study it so that I could manipulate it into all of the design elements through photography. The object that I chose was a beer
						bottle. After peeling off stickers and washing it, I became interested in its transparency and unique form. </p>
				</div> <!-- closing col-4 DIV -->

				<div class="col-8">
					<!-- a descriptive paragraph -->
					<p>I set up a makeshift studio with a large sheet of A1 paper and a lamp so that I could have a controlled environment. The basic white background also means that the focus is on the bottle. After taking the photos, I then put them all into Photoshop where I used the camera raw filter to give them all a higher contrast and with greater de-haze. By doing this, it brought greater attention to the line work and shadows of the bottle. I then decided to make them all black and white because I felt that it made the collection of images appear more cohesive.
					<br><br>I am very happy with how each image turned out. The restraint of only using beer bottles was challenging but I feel that this allowed my photography skill to be more apparent.</p>
